SJCL:  Searchable Encryption
============================

An extension to [The Stanford Javascript Crypto Library](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl), providing basic searchable symmetric encryption.


> Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows a party to outsource the storage of his data to another party in a private manner, while maintaining the ability to selectively search over it.
